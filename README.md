This repository contains machine learning models developed to predict the sizes of ZnO nanoparticles based on nine features. These models include CatBoost, Gradient Boosting, Extreme Gradient Boosting, and Random Forest Regressors. The features used for prediction are:

- Energy Band Gap (eV)
- Reaction Temperature (°C)
- Calcination Temperature (°C)
- Reaction Duration (hr)
- Calcination Duration (hr)
- Synthesis Method
- Precursor
- pH
- Precursor Concentration (M)
